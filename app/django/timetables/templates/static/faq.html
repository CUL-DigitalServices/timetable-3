<h1>Timetable Frequently Asked Questions</h1>


<h2>How do I export my timetable to my Google Calendar?</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Log into your Google Calendar</li>
    <li>Click the arrow button next to "Other calendars" and select "Add by URL"</li>
    <li>Copy and paste the link above into the "URL" box</li>
    <li>Click "Add Calendar"</li>
    <li>Your personal timetable is now displayed in your Google Calendar</li>

</ol>

<h2>Why are my events shown at different times in Timetable and my own
calendar?</h2>

<p>You'll need to check the timezone of your calendar. If you live outside
the UK, you may well have your Google or other calendar set to the
timezone in which you normally live. This means all the events will show
up as being at the wrong time. You can reset your calendar's timezone to
match the timezone Cambridge is in.</p>


<h2>Why aren't changes to my Timetable showing up in my (Google) calendar?</h2>

<p>Depending on which electronic calendar client you're using, and on its
settings, it can take up to 24 hours
for changes you make to your personal timetable to show up in your own
calendar. For example, Google Calendar only updates every 4-6 hours.</p>

<p>If you have reset your calendar feed using the 'reset feed' link, your
calendar won't receive updates, because it
can no longer communicate with the Timetable system. You will need to add
your new feed to your calendar client in order to see changes.</p>
