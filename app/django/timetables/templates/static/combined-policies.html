<h2 id="attendance">1. Rules applicable to attendance at Lectures</h2>
<p>
  Under the Universityâ€™s Ordinances<sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup>, matriculated students paying a University Composition Fee are entitled to attend any course within the University which is listed in the table of fees except courses of class work or practical instruction, or courses notified by the General Board as being specially restricted.
</p>

<p>
  The General Board has agreed the following definitions:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Lectures</dt>
  <dd>
    Presentations to groups, either single sessions or a series, which should be open to all students and published on the online Lecture Listings system.
  </dd>

  <dt>Class work</dt>
  <dd>
    To include seminars and clinical demonstrations where teaching is interactive and may require specific preparation by students beforehand, and which may be restricted to students registered for the course for which they are offered.
  </dd>

  <dt>Practical instruction</dt>
  <dd>
    Laboratory or classroom based teaching which includes instruction in small groups or one to one, and use of equipment (including computers), which may be restricted to students registered for the course for which they are offered.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  Students who wish to attend lectures for a subject for which they are not registered, will be permitted to do so only if accommodation is available after provision has been made for all those students for whom the course is primarily intended. Please check the details published by the Faculty or Department concerned before attending such lectures; students who are not formally registered for the course may be required to sign up in advance.

<h3>General</h3>
<p>
  This policy explains what information we gather when you visit the University of Cambridge Lecture List web site, and explains how that information is used. This policy applies only to direct accesses to the lecture list web site - URLs starting <a href="{{ site_url }}">{{ site_url }}</a>. You will need to consult the appropriate information on other sites for information on their policies.

<h4>General</h4>

<p>This policy explains the cookies that may be set as a result of your visiting the lecture list web site - URLs starting <a href="{{ site_url }}">{{ site_url }}</a>. You will need to consult the appropriate information on other sites for information on their policies. This policy is based on the <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/site/cookie-policy.html" target="_blank">policy for the University central web site</a>.</p>

<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but within your web browser you can choose to accept or decline cookies for any web site. You can usually modify your browser settings to decline all cookies if you prefer, or accept or decline on a case-by-case basis. The Information Commissioner's Office Advice for Members of the Public tells you how to control cookies. Bear in mind that disabling cookies may prevent you from taking full advantage of websites.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

<p>The cookies used on this site are there to:</p>
<ul class="actually-a-list">
  <li>authenticate you for accessing restricted content (your Raven authentication)</li>
  <li>measure how you use the website (using Google Analytics) so we can improve it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only the cookies associated with Raven identify you personally, when you request authentication; other cookies used on this site do not collect personal information. This website does not require Raven authentication if you are viewing information; it does require authentication if you are editing information, or if you are using the facility to build and save a personal timetable.</p>

<h4>Raven Authentication</h4>
<p>This site uses the University's Raven authentication service if it needs to identify you to give you access to restricted content. This may lead to two cookies being set:<p>

<ol class="actually-a-list">
  <li>One is set by and only returned to this server. It manages your authentication to this site. If you reject this cookie you will not be able to access restricted content on this site.</li>
  <li>The other is set by and returned to the server at raven.cam.ac.uk. This is used to implement Raven's 'single sign-on' function and allows Raven to identify you to other web sites without you having to re-enter your Raven password. Further information about this cookie, including how to disable it, can be found in the Raven Privacy and cookie policy at <a href="http://raven.cam.ac.uk/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://raven.cam.ac.uk/privacy.html</a>.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Google Analytics</h4>
<p>This site runs Google Analytics, which uses four cookies for tracking visitors to the site.</p>

<ul class="actually-a-list">
  <li>These cookies store information about what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page.</li>
  <li>No data specific to any identifiable user is retained, and we do not share our data with any other Google services.</li>
  <li>With the values gained from these cookies Google Analytics can interpret journeys through our website content, give us information about how people use our site and so present an opportunity to improve it.</li>
  <li>Google Analytics information about privacy and cookies may be found at <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies</a>.</li>
  <li>As a user you may opt out of the process Google Analytics uses to collect traffic log data (should your web browser be compatible). Google provides a browser add-on that enables a user to opt out of receiving Google Analytics cookies - <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</li>

  <h3>Data collected</h3>
  <p>In common with most web sites, this site automatically logs certain information about every request made of it (see below for more details). This information is used for system administration, for bug tracking, and for producing usage statistics. The logged information may be kept for up to two years. If you use the facility to create a personal timetable, then the site will store your timetable for you. The stored timetable is considered personal data under the Data Protection Act.</p>

  <h3>Logged data</h3>

  <p>The following data is automatically collected for each request:</p>
  <ul class="actually-a-list">
    <li>The name or network address of the computer making the request.

    <li>The username, when known during authenticated (logged in) access to the site</li>
    <li>The date and time of connection</li>

    <li>the service to which access was attempted,</li>
